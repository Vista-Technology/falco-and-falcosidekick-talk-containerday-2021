# Demo Architecture
![](./images/demo-architecture.png)

## Scope of the Demo
Let's take a practical example and consider the following use case:
- Requirements
	- Simple Kubernetes cluster as a starting point
	- Test POD deployed on the cluster with "malicious" behavior
		- ES: detect a network connection to a specific URL
		- ES: detect an unauthorized shell in the POD
    - Goals
        - Test the Falco Rules and intercept any violations
        - Integration for long-term monitoring (Loki, Prometheus, Grafana)
		- Integration with external alerting system (a Slack chhannel for example)
        - Implement automated remediation for the second violations
			- We simulate to apply a Kubernetes Network Policy to isolate and deny the outgoing traffic of the POD when we receive a network connection to vistatech.it website IPs

## How to reproduce the demo environment
Visit the [HowTo](./howto/) section

## POI (Point Of Interest)

### The Custom Falco Rule
We will simulate the "maliciuos" behaviour in 2 ways. The first one (detect an unauthorized shell in the POD) will use a standard default Falco Rules already present in the libraries. For the second test we have to create a custom Falco Rule for the scope.

In particlar we have to match the following requirements:
- Declare a list of IPs to be detected
- Detect an outbound network connection towards those IPs

Here the YAML definition of the Rule

```yaml
- list: website_ips
  items: ['"213.215.222.58"', '"213.215.222.59"']

- rule: Connection to vistatech.it
  desc: Detect attempts to connect to Vista Technology website 
  condition: outbound and fd.sip in (website_ips)
  output: Outbound connection to Vista Technology website https://www.vistatech.it 
        (command=%proc.cmdline connection=%fd.name container_id=%container.id container_name=%container.name 
        %container.info image=%container.image)
  priority: WARNING
  tags: [network]
```

As we can see, in the rule condition we are re-using some pre-writter Falco code, AKA macro: outbound.
Here the defintion of that macro (just for curiosity... we don't need to specify the macro again, it's already present and loaded).

```yaml
- macro: outbound
  condition: >
    (((evt.type = connect and evt.dir=<)) or
    (fd.typechar = 4 or fd.typechar = 6) and
    (fd.ip != "0.0.0.0" and fd.net != "127.0.0.0/8") and
    (evt.rawres >= 0 or evt.res = EINPROGRESS))
```

We can put the YAML definition code inside a file and pass this file when installing Falco, to allow Falco to load this Rule.

### The Serverless function

As we said before, we want to react to an event of outbound network traffic towards some specifi IPs. A possibile remediation would be to produce, in an automated way, a Kubernetes Netork Policy to patch a poissibile security breach.

This network policy will be resposible to deny all egress traffic from the POD.

Here a YAML example of the Network Policy definition

```yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-egress
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  policyTypes:
  - Egress

```

To automate the creation of the Network Policy we use a Python serverless function based on the Kubeless framework.

Here the Python code of the function

```python
from kubernetes import client,config
config.load_incluster_config()

def isolate_pod(event, context):
    rule = event['data']['rule'] or None
    output_fields = event['data']['output_fields'] or None

    if rule and rule == "Connection to vistatech.it" and output_fields:
        if output_fields['k8s.ns.name'] and output_fields['k8s.pod.name']:
			pod = output_fields['k8s.pod.name']
			namespace = output_fields['k8s.ns.name'] 
			body = client.V1NetworkPolicy(
				api_version="networking.k8s.io/v1",
				kind="NetworkPolicy",
				metadata=client.V1ObjectMeta(name="default-deny-egress"),
				spec=client.V1NetworkPolicySpec(
					pod_selector=client.V1LabelSelector(
						match_labels= {"app":"nginx"}),
						policy_types=["Egress"]))
						
			print (f"Isolating pod \"{pod}\" in namespace \"{namespace}\"")
			client.NetworkingV1Api().create_namespaced_network_policy(namespace=namespace, body=body)
```

## Test the whole architecture

Open a bash shell on our Nginx POD and check the outbound connection with a simple cURL command
```shell
ubuntu@containerday21:~$ kubectl -n demo exec -it nginx -- /bin/bash

root@nginx:/# curl -k https://vistatech.it
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="full" lang="it">

.....

```

We can check in Grafana our dashboard and Loki logs

![](./images/grafana.png)

![](./images/loki.png)

We can also see that some alerts came to our Slack

![](./images/slack.png)

The last thing that we have to check is the remediatin function.
If all went good we expect to see a brand new NetworkPolicy, to disallow egress traffic, associated to our POD

```shell
ubuntu@containerday21:~$ kubectl get networkpolicies -n demo
NAME                  POD-SELECTOR   AGE
default-deny-egress   app=nginx      8m44s
```
So, now it will be impossibile to navigate again

```shell
ubuntu@containerday21:~$ kubectl -n demo exec -it nginx -- /bin/bash

root@nginx:/# curl -k https://vistatech.it

curl: (6) Could not resolve host: vistatech.it
```

And... IT'S DONE!
